# sto_event_calculator_rs
This is a learning application for me experimenting with the Rust language.
It's principle purpose is calculating whether how long/if you will be able to complete an event in Star Trek Online.

All of my learning applications are based on a python script published by [/u/OfAuguryDefiant](https://www.reddit.com/user/OfAuguryDefiant) on reddit some time ago. While the original script was based on the old event system, I believe I can adapt it for the new system and learn some Rust at the same time.
